To get started, run getdata.sh to download all copyright protected assets into the project. This will take several minutes.
Godot will also have to import the assets. This will also take several minutes.
(Please note that getdata.sh will cleanup [read: rm -rf] the directories it updates.)

Note: what Github says is XML is actually cutscene dialog files (.pmd) masquerading as XML because that's the best syntax highlighting for them.
