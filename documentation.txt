.pmd files describe cutscenes.

There are 3 types of actors:
Characters (chara). Used in cutscenes or as NPCs. Never used in dungeons unless there's a very good reason for it.
Players (pchar). Used in free-walk environments like town or guild. Absolutely never used in dungeons.
Pokemon (pkmn). Used in dungeons.

Note: For the LOVE OF ARCEUS, do not put a <choicer>, <entry>, <await>, or any other input waiter inside an <async>. The game will skip a bunch of important stuff and can in some cases reach the wrong endpoint, softlock the cutscene, or even crash.
