.pmd files describe cutscenes.

There are 3 types of actors:
Characters (chara). Used in cutscenes or as NPCs. Never used in dungeons unless there's a very good reason for it.
Players (pchar). Used in free-walk environments like town or guild. Absolutely never used in dungeons.
Pokemon (pkmn). Used in dungeons.
